# Any environment variable specified here is injected into the build and/or
# runtime environment of the Docker container.
# The *Shared* flag determines if the value of the environment variable is shared
#   when this DevSpace is shared with others. The default is to share environment
#   variable values. If there is a value that should be set differently by every
#   developer that the DevSpace is shared with then Shared should be set to No.
#   An example of a value not to share is a API key that every developer generates
#   for themselves.
# The *Scope* enum determines if the environment variable is used at buildtime
# (docker build), runtime (docker run) or both. The acceptable values are 'run',
# 'build' and 'all'. If unspecified, scope is 'all' by default.

# When you bind your DevSpace to a local directory, the files will be synchronized

# If there are files that should not be synced, such as large objects or logs,
